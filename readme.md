# gRPC .NET/C# Sample Applications

Todo

## Basic

This example is a basic example of a client/server application, utilizing a shared `Protos` project containing the proto files used by both applications. 

## Code-First

This example utilizes the community project [protobuf-net.Grpc](https://protobuf-net.github.io/protobuf-net.Grpc/) and WCF-friendly conventions to support a code-first implementation of gRPC.
